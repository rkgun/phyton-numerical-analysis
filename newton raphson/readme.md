In numerical analysis, it is named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson.
Newton – Raphson method for roots of real-valued functions
to find better approaches, repeatedly and quickly
is a method used. <br/>

A straight line tangent to a continuous and differentiable function
He uses the idea that he can approach with <br/>

The method is a function f defined on the real numbers x,
The derivative of the function f' and the first for a root of the function f
guess starts with x0. If the function satisfies sufficient assumptions
and if the first guess is close, x1 which is a better value than x_0; <br/>
x_1=x_0-(f(x_0)/f'(x_0)) available in the form.

Convergence to the true root; between root and approximation
The margin of error is quadraticly related at each step. <br/>

There are also some difficulties with the method; Newton's second method
If the assumptions made in the proof of degree convergence are not met,
convergence slows down for the roots of the function. <br/>
