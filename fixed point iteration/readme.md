#Fixed Point Iteration **Enter**
Let f(x) be a continuous and bounded function in the interval \[a,b\].
Suppose we want to find a r∈\[a,b\] satisfying the condition f(r)=0. **Enter**
In this case, it is clear that we can write the equation f(x)=0 in the form x=g(x).
It is clear that while x∈\[a,b\] is g(x)∈\[a,b\]. On the other hand, the g(x) function is continuous.
and be limited. **Enter**

If we choose x_(n+1)=g(x_n), n=0,1,2,3,... we get f(x_(n+1))=f(g(x_n)).
Thus, the \[a,b\] range is scanned faster. **Enter**
